# Empower The Nation Group Assignment #

For this assignment I was apart of group 3, this group consisted of myself (Gaia Kipling), Lethabo Kok and Chrines Katete, we were tasked with creating a mobile application and a website for an organisation called "Empowering The Nation".
Both the platforms needed to consist of a homepage, 2 courses pages (1 for six-week courses and 1 for six-month courses), a contact us page (that conatins our phone number, our email address, our web address and our organisation's location), and a form page (where the user will be able to view how much courses will cost with VAT and discounts, as well as request a consultant to contact them and get a quote sent directly to their gmail or their companies gmail).

We divided the work into 3 parts, and we each choose a part that we felt best suited us. I choose to do the app, Chrines choose to do the website and Lethabo choose to do the PowerPoint presentation.
